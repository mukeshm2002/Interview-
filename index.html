    <h1>📚 Interview Preparation Guide</h1>

    <h2>👤 Self Introduction</h2>
    <p>Good morning. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. <br><br>
        My name is **Mukesh**, and I’m from Mayiladuthurai. I completed my B.Tech in 2024 from Annai College of
        Engineering and Technology. <br><br>
        I specialize in **Back-End Development** using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**. I’m also familiar with
        Git/GitHub for version control, Mockito for testing, and I connect the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Spring
        Thymeleaf. <br><br>
        I’ve built three major projects — an **Online Bus Ticket Reservation System** with Role-Based Access Control, an
        **Employee Management System**, and a **Patient Appointment and Medicine Management System**. All these projects
        use **RESTful APIs** and **CRUD operations** with a strong backend structure. <br><br>
        After completing my technical course, I realized I needed to improve my depth of knowledge, especially after
        failing two mock interviews. So, I spent the last three months in focused **self-study** — improving my Java,
        Spring Boot, and **Data Structures & Algorithms** skills. <br><br>
        My next goal is to learn React so that I can become a **Full-Stack Developer**. <br><br>
        I’m confident that my dedication and preparation have made me ready for this opportunity.
    </p>

    <h2>⚙️ Technical Overview</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Full-Stack Development :</h3>
        A Java **Full Stack Developer** is someone who works on both the **front-end** and **back-end** of a web
        application. <br>
        On the back-end, we use **Java** and **Spring Boot** to handle the main logic, security, and database connection
        — usually with **MySQL**. <br>
        On the front-end, we use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to design the user interface and make it
        interactive. <br><br>
        So basically, a Java Full Stack Developer manages everything — from how data is stored in the backend to how it’s
        displayed to the user on the frontend.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Problem solving platform :</h3>
        I actively practice problem-solving on platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode** to strengthen my DSA
        skills. I focus on medium-level array, string, and algorithm problems.

                    <h3>Class & Object :</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Java, a **Class** is like a blueprint or template that defines how an object should be —
                            it contains variables and methods.</li>
                        <li>An **Object** is an actual instance of a class — it’s created from that blueprint and has
                            real values.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>OOPS 4 Pillars :</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Encapsulation**: Wrapping (or combining) data (variables) and methods (functions) that
                            operate on that data into a single unit (class).</li>
                        <li>**Inheritance**: A class (child) can inherit the properties and methods of another class
                            (parent).</li>
                        <li>**Polymorphism**: The same method can behave differently based on the object calling it.
                            Types: Compile-time (**Method Overloading**), Runtime (**Method Overriding**)</li>
                        <li>**Abstraction**: Showing only the important details and hiding the implementation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Method Overloading and Method Overriding :</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Method Overloading** happens within the same class, when multiple methods have the same
                            name but different parameters (different type, number, or order). It’s a **compile-time
                            polymorphism**.</li>
                        <li>**Method Overriding** happens in different classes — a child class provides a new version of
                            a method that already exists in its parent class. It’s a **runtime polymorphism**.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Abstract class vs Interface :</h3>
                    An **abstract class** is used when we want to share common behavior among subclasses, and it can
                    have both abstract and normal methods. <br><br>
                    An **interface** defines a contract that classes must follow — it supports multiple inheritance and
                    achieves full abstraction. <br><br>
                    > *Usecase*: In my Bus Booking Project, I used **interfaces** like `BookingService` and
                    `PaymentService` to define structure, and **abstract classes** like `User` for shared properties
                    between Admin and Customer.

                    <h3>Exception Handling (and Custom Exceptions):</h3>
                    In Java, **Exception Handling** is a way to manage runtime errors so that the application doesn’t
                    crash and can handle unexpected situations smoothly. <br><br>
                    > *Usecase*: In my Online Bus Booking Project, I used **custom exceptions** to handle specific error
                    cases clearly and user-friendly. For example: `NoRouteFoundException`, `BusNotFoundException`,
                    `InsufficientSeatException`, and `SeatAlreadyBookedException`. These custom exceptions made my
                    application more user-friendly, maintainable, and professional.

                    <h3>Throw and Throws :</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The **throw** keyword is used to manually throw an exception inside a method or block of
                            code. It’s followed by an object of an exception class (like `new Exception()`).</li>
                        <li>The **throws** keyword is used in a method declaration to tell the compiler that this method
                            might throw an exception, and it should be handled by the calling method.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>final, finally, and finalize()</h3>
                    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">

                    </table>
                    <h3>Stream API & Lambda Expressions :</h3>
                    The **Stream API** and **Lambda Expressions** were introduced in Java 8 to make code more readable,
                    concise, and functional. <br>
                    They help in processing collections (like filtering, mapping, sorting) easily without writing
                    traditional loops. A **Lambda Expression** is basically a short form of writing a method — it helps
                    to reduce boilerplate code. <br><br>

                    <h3>String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer :</h3>
                    In Java, **String** is **immutable** — once created, it can’t be changed. <br>
                    **StringBuilder** and **StringBuffer** are **mutable**, meaning they can be modified. <br>
                    The difference is — **StringBuilder** is faster but **not thread-safe**, while **StringBuffer** is
                    **thread-safe** but a bit slower. <br>
                    > *Usecase*: I usually prefer **StringBuilder** when working on single-threaded applications for
                    better performance.
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>Java Collections Frameworks (Usecase) :</h3>
                    The Java Collections Framework provides pre-built classes and interfaces to store and manage data
                    efficiently. It includes structures like **List**, **Set**, **Map**, and **Queue**. <br><br>
                    > *Usecase*: For example, in my Bus Booking Project, I used **ArrayList** to store and display
                    available buses, **HashMap** to map routes with seat counts, and **Queue** to manage waiting
                    passengers. These collections helped me improve performance, handle data efficiently, and simplify
                    backend logic.
                    <br><br>

                    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) :</h3>
                    **Data Structures** help in organizing and storing data efficiently. **Algorithms** are step-by-step
                    methods to solve problems. I've studied and practiced all the important DSA topics, such as Arrays,
                    Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, HashMaps, Recursion, Sorting, and Searching algorithms. <br><br>
                    > *Usecase*: In my Bus Booking Project, I used **ArrayLists** and **HashMaps** to manage bus
                    details. I used **searching algorithms** to quickly find buses and **sorting logic** to arrange
                    buses by time/price. So, DSA helps me write optimized, clean, and efficient code.

                    <h3>Design Pattern :</h3>
                    **Design Patterns** are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help make the code
                    more reusable, maintainable, and scalable. <br><br>
                    There are three main types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>**Creational Patterns** – For object creation (like Singleton, Factory).</li>
                        <li>**Structural Patterns** – For class and object composition (like Adapter, Facade).</li>
                        <li>**Behavioral Patterns** – For communication between objects (like Observer, Strategy).</li>
                    </ul>
                    > *Usecase*: I used the **Singleton Pattern** for database connection in the Bus Booking Project. I
                    used the **Factory Pattern** in the Employee Management System to create different types of employee
                    objects based on their roles.

                    <h3>Pattern Programming :</h3>
                    Pattern printing helps test **nested loop logic**. I use outer loops for rows and inner loops for
                    columns or spaces. I’ve practiced star, number, and pyramid patterns to strengthen my loop logic and
                    improve coding efficiency.

                    <h3>Spring Boot :</h3>
                    Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework. Its main goal is to make it easier
                    and faster to start and develop Spring applications. <br><br>
                    The main idea is **“Convention over Configuration”** (தானாகவே கட்டமைத்தல்), meaning it uses smart
                    defaults so we don’t have to set up everything ourselves. Another big advantage is **embedded
                        servers** (like Tomcat), which let us run the app directly as a single JAR file. <br>

                    <h3>Spring MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller) :</h3>
                    Spring MVC helps to separate the **logic (Model)**, **design (View)**, and **user input
                        (Controller)** of an application. <br><br>
                    Controller → calls the Model (Service/Repo) → Model handles business logic/data → Controller passes
                    data to the View. <br><br>
                    > *Usecase*: In my Employee Management System, the **Controllers** handled API requests, the
                    **Services** managed the business logic, and the **Repositories** connected with the database.

                    <h3>Rest API :</h3>
                    A **RESTful API** (Representational State Transfer) is used to build communication between the
                    client and server using standard HTTP methods.
                    <ul>
                        <li>**GET** → to fetch data</li>
                        <li>**POST** → to add new data</li>
                        <li>**PUT** → to update existing data</li>
                        <li>**DELETE** → to remove data</li>
                    </ul>
                    We use the `@RestController` annotation and `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., to map URLs to
                    methods. The methods usually return **JSON** data. <br><br>

                    <h3>Database Connectivity (Spring Data JPA) :</h3>
                    Connecting Spring Boot to a database is very easy with **Spring Data JPA**.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency.</li>
                        <li>Set up database URL, username, and password in `application.properties`.</li>
                        <li>Create data models as **JPA entities** (e.g., `@Entity` Employee class).</li>
                        <li>Make **repository interfaces** by extending `JpaRepository`, which automatically gives all
                            basic **CRUD** operations.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Spring Security :</h3>
                    Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides **authentication** (verifying who the user is)
                    and **authorization** (checking what the user is allowed to do). <br><br>
                    Adding `spring-boot-starter-security` sets up basic security. It can be customized by defining user
                    **roles** and securing APIs with **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication. <br>

                    <h3>Spring Thymeleaf (View Layer) :</h3>
                    Spring **Thymeleaf** is a **server-side template engine** used to create dynamic web pages.
                    <br><br>
                    The Controller sends data to the Thymeleaf template, where we use expressions like
                    `${employee.name}` to display that data inside HTML. Thymeleaf processes these placeholders and
                    sends the final HTML page to the browser. This keeps the design separate from business logic.

                    <h3>Test Cases Integration (Mockito) :</h3>
                    I used **Mockito** with **JUnit** for writing **unit test cases** in Spring Boot. <br>
                    Mockito helps me test the logic of a **Service** class by creating **mock** dependencies (like a
                    Repository) using `@Mock` and `@InjectMocks`. This allows me to focus only on testing the business
                    logic without hitting the real database, making testing faster and more reliable.

                    <h3>Semantic HTML :</h3>
                    Semantic HTML elements provide **structure and meaning** to web content, making it more accessible
                    and understandable for browsers and developers. Examples: `&lt;header&gt;`, `&lt;footer&gt;`,
                    `&lt;article&gt;`, `&lt;section&gt;`, `&lt;nav&gt;`.
                    <h3>CSS Box Model :</h3>
                    The CSS box model describes every element as a box with **content**, **padding**, **border**, and
                    **margin**. It's crucial for designing layouts.
                    <h3>Key CSS Properties :</h3>
                    Commonly used properties include `margin` and `padding` for spacing, `color` and `font-size` for
                    typography, `display` and `position` for layout, and `border` for visual separation.
                    <h3>DOM Manipulation :</h3>
                    **DOM manipulation** is using JavaScript to dynamically change the **content**, **structure**, or
                    **style** of a webpage, making it interactive.
                    <h3>Event Loop in JavaScript :</h3>
                    The **event loop** is a mechanism that handles **asynchronous code execution** and ensures that
                    events are processed when the main thread (Call Stack) is available (Non-blocking I/O).
