  <h1>📚 Interview Preparation</h1>

  <div>
    <h3>Self Intro</h3>
    Good morning. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. <br>

    My name is Mukesh, and I’m from Mayiladuthurai. I completed my B.Tech in 2024 from Annai College of Engineering and
    Technology. <br> <br>

    I specialize in Back-End Development using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I’m also familiar with Git/GitHub for
    version control, Mockito for testing, and I connect the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Spring Thymeleaf. <br> <br>

    I’ve built three major projects — an Online Bus Ticket Reservation System with Role-Based Access Control, an
    Employee Management System, and a Patient Appointment and Medicine Management System. All these projects use RESTful
    APIs and CRUD operations with a strong backend structure. <br> <br>

    After completing my technical course, I realized I needed to improve my depth of knowledge, especially after failing
    two mock interviews. So, I spent the last three months in focused self-study — improving my Java, Spring Boot, and
    Data Structures & Algorithms skills. <br> <br>

    My next goal is to learn React so that I can become a Full-Stack Developer. <br>

    I’m confident that my dedication and preparation have made me ready for this opportunity. <br> <br>

    <h3>Full-Stack Development :</h3>

    A Java Full Stack Developer is someone who works on both the front-end and back-end of a web application. <br>

    On the back-end, we use Java and Spring Boot to handle the main logic, security, and database connection — usually
    with MySQL. <br>
    On the front-end, we use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the user interface and make it interactive. <br>

    So basically, a Java Full Stack Developer manages everything — from how data is stored in the backend to how it’s
    displayed to the user on the frontend. <br> <br>

        <div class="answer">
          <h3>Class & Object :</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> In Java, a Class is like a blueprint or template that defines how an object should be — it contains
              variables and methods.</li>
            <li>An Object is an actual instance of a class — it’s created from that blueprint and has real values.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>OOPS 4 Pillars :</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation : Wrapping (or combining) data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that
              data into a single unit (class).</li>
            <li>Inheritance : A class (child) can inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent).</li>
            <li>Polymorphism : The same method can behave differently based on the object calling it. Types:
              Compile-time (Method Overloading), Runtime (Method Overriding)</li>
            <li>Abstraction : Showing only the important details and hiding the implementation.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Method Overloading and Method Overriding :</h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Method Overloading happens within the same class, when multiple methods have the same name but
              different parameters (different type, number, or order). It’s a compile-time polymorphism.</li>
            <li>Method Overriding happens in different classes — a child class provides a new version of a method that
              already exists in its parent class. It’s a runtime polymorphism.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Abstract class vs Interface :</h3>
          An abstract class is used when we want to share common behavior among subclasses, and it can have both
          abstract and normal methods. <br>

          An interface defines a contract that classes must follow — it supports multiple inheritance and achieves full
          abstraction. <br>

          In my Bus Booking Project, I used interfaces like BookingService and PaymentService to define structure, and
          abstract classes like User for shared properties between Admin and Customer. <br> <br>

          <h3>Exception Handling :</h3>
          In Java, Exception Handling is a way to manage runtime errors so that the application doesn’t crash and can
          handle unexpected situations smoothly. <br>

          In my Online Bus Booking Project, I used custom exceptions to handle specific error cases clearly and
          user-friendly. <br>

          For example:

          NoRouteFoundException – if no routes are available, it shows a message like “No routes available, please try
          another route.” <br>

          BusNotFoundException – if no buses are found on a selected date, it displays “No buses available, please
          change the date.” <br>

          InsufficientSeatException – when all seats are booked, it shows “All seats are booked.” <br>

          SeatAlreadyBookedException – if a user tries to book a taken seat, it says “This seat is already booked,
          please choose another.” <br>

          These custom exceptions made my application more user-friendly, maintainable, and professional, as each
          problem is handled properly instead of showing a generic error. <br> <br>

          <h3>Throw and Throws :</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The throw keyword is used to manually throw an exception inside a method or block of code.
              It’s followed by an object of an exception class (like new Exception()).</li>
            <li>The throws keyword is used in a method declaration to tell the compiler that this method might throw an
              exception, and it should be handled by the calling method.</li>
          </ul>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <h3>Stream API :</h3>
          The Stream API and Lambda Expressions were introduced in Java 8 to make code more readable, concise, and
          functional.
          They help in processing collections (like filtering, mapping, sorting) easily without writing traditional
          loops. <br><br>

          <h3>Lambda Expressions :</h3>
          A Lambda Expression is basically a short form of writing a method — it helps to reduce boilerplate code,
          especially in functional interfaces. <br> <br>
          <h3>String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer :</h3>
          In Java, String is immutable — once created, it can’t be changed.
          StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable, meaning they can be modified.
          The difference is — StringBuilder is faster but not thread-safe, while StringBuffer is thread-safe but a bit
          slower.
          I usually prefer StringBuilder when working on single-threaded applications for better performance.
          <br><br>
          <h3>Array :</h3>
          Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type under one variable.
          I used arrays in my Bus Booking project to manage temporary data like seat availability and bus routes before
          connecting to MySQL.
          It helped me perform quick operations like searching, updating, and validating seat numbers efficiently.” <br>
          <br>
          <h3>Java Collections Framworks :</h3>
          The Java Collections Framework provides pre-built classes and interfaces to store and manage data efficiently.
          It includes structures like List, Set, Map, and Queue. <br>

          For example, in my Bus Booking Project, I used ArrayList for storing bus details, HashSet for unique routes,
          and HashMap for mapping booking IDs to their booking details.

          <h3> Usecase : </h3>
          “I’ve worked with major Java collections like ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, Queue, and Stack in my
          Spring Boot projects.
          For example, I used ArrayList to store and display available buses, HashMap to map routes with seat counts,
          and Queue to manage waiting passengers.
          These collections helped me improve performance, handle data efficiently, and simplify backend logic.”
          <ul>
            <li>I used ArrayList to store and display available buses</li>
            <li>HashMap to map routes with seat counts</li>
            <li>Queue to manage waiting passengers</li>
          </ul>
          These collections helped me improve performance, handle data efficiently, and simplify backend logic.”
          <br>
          <h3>DSA :</h3>
          DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms.

          Data Structures help in organizing and storing data efficiently — like Arrays, Lists, Maps, and Trees.
          Algorithms are step-by-step methods to solve problems — like Searching, Sorting, and Traversal techniques.
          <br>

          I’ve studied and practiced all the important DSA topics, such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues,
          HashMaps, Recursion, Sorting, and Searching algorithms. <br> <br>

          In my Bus Booking Project, I used data structures and algorithms in many places — <br>

          I used ArrayLists and HashMaps to store and manage bus details, routes, and bookings efficiently. <br>

          I used searching algorithms to quickly find buses between selected routes. <br>

          I used sorting logic to arrange buses by departure time or ticket price. <br>

          In my Employee Management System, I applied HashMaps for quick access to employee data and lists for CRUD
          operations. <br>

          So, DSA helps me write optimized, clean, and efficient code, which improves both performance and scalability
          in real-world projects. <br> <br>

          <h3>Design Pattern :</h3>
          Design Patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.
          They help make the code more reusable, maintainable, and scalable. <br>

          In simple words, instead of solving the same type of problem again and again, we use a standard approach —
          that’s what a design pattern provides. <br> <br>

          There are three main types of design patterns: <br>

          Creational Patterns – For object creation (like Singleton, Factory). <br>

          Structural Patterns – For class and object composition (like Adapter, Facade). <br>

          Behavioral Patterns – For communication between objects (like Observer, Strategy). <br><br>

          In my Bus Booking Project, I used the Singleton Pattern for database connection — ensuring only one instance
          of the connection is created throughout the application. <br>

          In my Employee Management System, I used the Factory Pattern to create different types of employee objects
          based on their roles. <br>

          These patterns helped me reduce code duplication, improve flexibility, and make debugging easier. <br> <br>

          <h3>Pattern Programming :</h3>

          “Pattern printing helps test nested loop logic.
          I use outer loops for rows and inner loops for columns or spaces.
          I’ve practiced star, number, and pyramid patterns to strengthen my loop logic and improve coding efficiency.”

            <h3>Spring Boot :</h3>
            Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework.
            Its main goal is to make it easier and faster to start and develop Spring applications. <br>
            It removes the need for lots of manual configuration, so developers can focus on writing business logic.
            <br>
            <br>

            The main idea of Spring Boot is “Convention over Configuration”, meaning it uses smart defaults so we don’t
            have to set up everything ourselves. <br>

            For example, if we add spring-boot-starter-web, it automatically sets up everything needed for a web app —
            like the Dispatcher Servlet and other MVC parts. <br>

            Another big advantage is embedded servers like Tomcat or Jetty.
            They let us run the app directly as a single JAR file, without installing a separate server. <br><br>

            <h3>Spring MVC :</h3>
            Spring MVC is a main part of building web applications in Spring.
            MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, and it helps to separate the logic, design, and user input of an
            application. <br>

            When a user sends a request, the Controller receives it.
            The Controller then calls the Model, which handles the business logic and data.
            After processing, the Model sends the data back to the Controller.
            Finally, the Controller passes that data to the View (like a Thymeleaf page or JSON response) to show it to
            the user. <br>

            This structure keeps the code clean, easy to test, and simple to maintain. <br>

            For example, in my Employee Management System,
            the Controllers handled API requests,
            the Services managed the business logic,
            and the Repositories connected with the database. <br> <br>

            <h3>View Layer : </h3>
            In Spring MVC architecture, the View layer is the part that shows data to the user — it’s what users
            actually
            see and interact with, like employee details, bus routes, or appointment timings. <br>

            The View layer can be built using different technologies.
            In my projects, such as the Employee Management System, I used Thymeleaf for the View layer.
            Thymeleaf is a server-side template engine that helps us add dynamic data into HTML pages. <br>

            After the Controller gets data from the Model, it chooses which Thymeleaf template to use and passes the
            data
            to it.
            Then Thymeleaf processes that data and creates the final HTML page, which is sent to the user’s browser.

            This setup helps to keep the design (view) separate from business logic, while still allowing dynamic web
            pages. <br> <br>

            <h3>Rest API :</h3>
            In Spring Boot, a RESTful API is used to build communication between the client and server using HTTP
            methods.
            REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it follows a simple rule — use standard HTTP methods
            for
            operations.

            For example:
            <ul>
              <li>GET → to fetch data</li>

              <li>POST → to add new data</li>

              <li>PUT → to update existing data</li>

              <li>DELETE → to remove data</li>
            </ul>
            In Spring Boot, we create REST APIs using the @RestController annotation.
            Inside that, we map URLs to methods using annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and
            @DeleteMapping.

            The methods usually return JSON data, which the client (like React, Angular, or mobile app) can easily use.

            For example, I created REST APIs in my Employee Management System, where the controller handled employee
            CRUD
            operations — like adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee details.

            This makes the application lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate with any frontend or external
            system.

            <h3>Database Connectivity :</h3>
            Connecting Spring Boot to a database is very easy with Spring Data JPA. <br>

            First, we add the spring-boot-starter-data-jpa dependency.
            It includes everything we need, including Hibernate, which helps map Java classes to database tables. <br>
            <br>

            Next, we set up the database connection in the application.properties file.
            We just add the database URL, username, and password, and Spring Boot automatically creates the connection
            for
            us. <br>

            Then, we create our data models as JPA entities.
            For example, an Employee class marked with @Entity will be linked to an employee table in the database. <br>
            <br>

            Finally, we make repository interfaces by extending JpaRepository.
            This gives us all the basic CRUD operations — like save, find, update, and delete — without writing extra
            code. <br>

            This makes database handling simple and fast, so we can focus more on our business logic. <br> <br>

            <h3>Spring Security :</h3>
            Spring Security is a powerful framework that provides authentication and authorization for Spring
            applications. <br>

            It helps protect applications by ensuring that only the right users can access specific parts of the system.
            <br>

            Authentication means verifying who the user is — usually through a username and password. <br>

            Authorization means checking what the user is allowed to do — like accessing certain APIs or pages. <br>

            In Spring Boot, adding spring-boot-starter-security automatically sets up basic security. It secures all
            endpoints and provides a default login page. <br>

            You can customize it by defining user roles, using a database for user details, or securing APIs with JWT
            (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication. <br>

            Overall, Spring Security makes it simple to build secure, role-based, and token-based authentication systems
            in Spring Boot applications. <br> <br>


            <h3>Spring Thymeleaf :</h3>
            Spring Thymeleaf is a server-side template engine used in Spring Boot applications to create dynamic web
            pages. <br>

            It allows you to combine HTML with Spring data — meaning you can easily show data from your backend directly
            in your web pages. <br>

            The Controller sends data (like employee details or user info) to the Thymeleaf template. <br>

            In the template, we use simple expressions like ${employee.name} to display that data inside the HTML. <br>

            When the page is rendered, Thymeleaf replaces those placeholders with real data and sends the final HTML to
            the browser. <br>

            Thymeleaf works well with Spring MVC and supports form handling, loops, conditions, and
            internationalization.
            <br>

            It’s easy to read, looks like normal HTML, and helps keep your frontend and backend connected smoothly while
            building dynamic web apps. <br> <br>

            <h3>Test Cases Integration :</h3>
            In my project, I used Mockito for writing unit test cases in Spring Boot.
            Mockito helps me test the logic of a class without using real dependencies like a database or external API.
            <br>

            For example, if I’m testing a Service class, I can create a mock repository using the @Mock annotation, and
            inject it into my service using @InjectMocks.
            Then, I can define how the mock should behave — like returning some fake data when a method is called. <br>

            This way, I can focus only on testing my business logic, not the real database.
            It makes testing faster, easier, and more reliable. <br>

            I usually write these test cases using JUnit along with Mockito, to check if my methods return the correct
            results or handle exceptions properly. <br>

            <h3>Semantic HTML :</h3>
            Semantic HTML elements provide structure and meaning to web content, making it more accessible and
            understandable for browsers and developers. They help improve the overall readability and maintainability of
            the code. Some common semantic elements include: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;,
            &lt;section&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, and &lt;nav&gt;.
            <h3>CSS Properties :</h3>
            The most commonly used CSS properties include margin and padding for spacing, color and font-size for
            typography, display and position for layout, and border for creating borders.
            <h3>CSS box model :</h3>
            The CSS box model describes every element as a box with content, padding, border, and margin. It's used for
            designing layouts.
            <h3>CSS selectors :</h3>
            CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements that need to be styled. They include tag, class, and ID selectors.
            <h3>DOM manipulation :</h3>
            DOM manipulation is the act of using JavaScript to dynamically change the content, structure, or style of a webpage.
            <h3>Event loop in JavaScript :</h3>
            The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous code execution and ensures that events are processed when the main thread is available.

      <h3>Git & Github :</h3>
      Git is a distributed version control system that lets developers track changes in their code and collaborate on
      projects. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, along with features for
      project management, collaboration, and code review.
