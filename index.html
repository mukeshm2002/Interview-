  <h1>Java Full Stack Developer - Interview Questions</h1>

  <!-- Personal Introduction -->
  <div class="category">üßë‚Äçüíº Personal Introduction</div>
  <div class="question">1. Tell me about yourself</div>
  <div class="answer">I‚Äôm Mukesh from Mayiladuthurai. I completed my B.Tech in 2024 from Annai College of Engineering and Technology. I specialize in Backend Development using Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I‚Äôve built multiple CRUD-based applications like Bus Ticket Reservation, Employee Management, and Patient Appointment System. I‚Äôm currently improving my full-stack skills with React.</div>

  <div class="question">2. What is a Java Full Stack Developer?</div>
  <div class="answer">A Java Full Stack Developer works on both Frontend and Backend parts of a web application. Backend uses Java and Spring Boot to handle business logic and database operations, while Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the UI and interactivity.</div>

  <!-- Core Java -->
  <div class="category">‚òï Core Java</div>
  <div class="question">3. What are Classes and Objects?</div>
  <div class="answer">A Class is a blueprint that defines properties and behaviors (methods). An Object is an instance of a class. Example: Car is a class, and myCar is an object with specific attributes.</div>

  <div class="question">4. Explain Method Overloading and Overriding</div>
  <div class="answer">Method Overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method from its superclass.</div>

  <div class="question">5. What is Exception Handling?</div>
  <div class="answer">Exception handling manages runtime errors using try-catch blocks. In my Bus Booking project, I created custom exceptions like NoRouteFoundException, BusNotFoundException, InsufficientSeatException, and SeatAlreadyBookedException for better user messages.</div>

  <div class="question">6. What is the difference between throw and throws?</div>
  <div class="answer">‚Äòthrow‚Äô is used to manually throw an exception. ‚Äòthrows‚Äô declares exceptions that a method might throw, informing the calling method to handle them.</div>

  <div class="question">7. What are String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?</div>
  <div class="answer">String is immutable, meaning changes create a new object. StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable. StringBuilder is faster (not thread-safe), while StringBuffer is thread-safe.</div>

  <div class="question">8. What are the main features from Java 8 to 25?</div>
  <div class="answer">Key features include Lambda expressions, Stream API, Optional class, Modules, Records, Pattern Matching, Virtual Threads, and improved performance.</div>

  <div class="question">9. Explain Abstract Classes and Interfaces</div>
  <div class="answer">Abstract classes can have both abstract and concrete methods. Interfaces only define method signatures. In Spring, interfaces like JpaRepository define contracts implemented by classes.</div>

  <div class="question">10. What is the Java Collections Framework?</div>
  <div class="answer">It provides data structures like List, Set, Map, and Queue. Example: I used ArrayList to store employees, HashMap to map IDs to routes, and HashSet to avoid duplicate seats in my Bus Booking System.</div>

  <div class="question">11. What are Stream API and Lambda Expressions?</div>
  <div class="answer">Lambda Expressions simplify code using short syntax. Stream API is used for processing collections (filter, map, reduce). I used Stream to filter available buses or employees in projects.</div>

  <div class="question">12. What is an Array? How did you use it?</div>
  <div class="answer">An Array stores multiple elements of the same type. I used arrays for seat number tracking in my Bus Booking System before switching to dynamic lists.</div>

  <div class="question">13. What are some common pattern programs?</div>
  <div class="answer">Example: Printing triangles, pyramids, and number patterns. It improves logic and nested loop understanding.</div>

  <!-- Spring Boot -->
  <div class="category">üåø Spring Boot</div>
  <div class="question">14. What is Spring Boot?</div>
  <div class="answer">Spring Boot simplifies Java application development with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and less boilerplate code. I used it in all my backend projects for quick deployment and API creation.</div>

  <div class="question">15. Explain Spring Boot Modules</div>
  <div class="answer">Spring Core (IoC), Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring Test are key modules. Each supports a specific layer of the app.</div>

  <div class="question">16. Explain Spring MVC Architecture</div>
  <div class="answer">Model-View-Controller: Model handles data, View displays UI, Controller manages requests. In my Employee System, Controller fetched employee data and displayed it using Thymeleaf templates.</div>

  <div class="question">17. What is Spring Security?</div>
  <div class="answer">Spring Security provides authentication and authorization. I used it for login validation and role-based access in my Bus Ticket Reservation System.</div>

  <div class="question">18. How do you connect a database in Spring Boot?</div>
  <div class="answer">By configuring application.properties with datasource details and using JPA repositories for CRUD operations. Example: Connecting to MySQL in Employee Management System.</div>

  <div class="question">19. What is RESTful API?</div>
  <div class="answer">RESTful APIs allow communication between frontend and backend via HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. I created REST APIs for all CRUD operations in my projects.</div>

  <div class="question">20. What are Design Patterns and how did you use them?</div>
  <div class="answer">Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems. Example: Singleton for database connections, MVC pattern in project structure, and Factory pattern for object creation.</div>

  <div class="question">21. What is JPA and its interfaces?</div>
  <div class="answer">JPA simplifies ORM with interfaces like EntityManager, JpaRepository, and CrudRepository. I used JpaRepository for easy database operations.</div>

  <div class="question">22. What is DispatcherServlet?</div>
  <div class="answer">It is the front controller in Spring MVC that receives all requests and forwards them to appropriate controllers.</div>

  <div class="question">23. What is Tomcat Server?</div>
  <div class="answer">Tomcat is a lightweight web server that runs Java web applications. Spring Boot uses an embedded Tomcat server to deploy applications easily.</div>

  <!-- Testing and Tools -->
  <div class="category">üß™ Testing & Tools</div>
  <div class="question">24. Explain Spring Integration in Unit Testing</div>
